- **Medium-error files (50-200 errors)**: Targeted fixes for specific interface issues
- **Low-error files (<50 errors)**: Cleanup and optimization

### **Impact Distribution**
- **80% of progress** came from rewriting just 4 high-error files
- **Service layer fixes** had the highest impact on overall error reduction  
- **Interface standardization** eliminated cascading errors across multiple files

## 📈 **Next Steps Recommendation**

### **Immediate (High ROI)**
1. **Complete remaining service rewrites** (dataMigrationService, anonymityService, notificationService)
2. **Fix store test interface mismatches** for development workflow improvement
3. **Address crisis service method alignments** for feature completeness

### **Medium Term (Maintenance)**  
1. **Unused import cleanup** for code quality
2. **View component property fixes** for remaining type safety
3. **Configuration optimization** for build performance

### **Long Term (Enhancement)**
1. **Expand test coverage** for new type-safe services
2. **Performance monitoring** implementation for production insights
3. **Enhanced accessibility** compliance across all components

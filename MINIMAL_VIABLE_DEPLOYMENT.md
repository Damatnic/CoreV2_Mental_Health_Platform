## Critical Safety Features

### Crisis Detection Keywords
The system monitors for critical keywords in real-time:
- **Critical:** suicide, kill myself, end it all
- **High:** self harm, cutting, overdose
- **Medium:** depressed, anxious, panic
- **Low:** stressed, worried, sad

### Emergency Resources
```javascript
// Always available resources
const EMERGENCY_RESOURCES = {
  crisis_hotline: '988',
  crisis_text: 'Text HOME to 741741',
  emergency: '911',
  samhsa: '1-800-662-4357'
};
```

### Escalation Protocol
1. Keyword detected ‚Üí Risk assessment
2. High/Critical risk ‚Üí Automatic 988 display
3. Persistent notification with resources
4. Helper notification (if available)
5. Documentation for follow-up

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
```bash

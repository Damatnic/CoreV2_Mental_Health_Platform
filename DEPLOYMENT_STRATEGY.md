# ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY - CoreV2 Mental Health Platform

## Current Status (August 29, 2025)

### âœ… Completed
- All critical backend files created
- Browser compatibility issues fixed
- Database schema and migrations ready
- Environment variables configured
- Authentication service fixed for browser

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Installing dependencies via Yarn (more reliable than npm)
- Background process: bash_5

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Complete Yarn Installation**
   - Monitor bash_5 for completion
   - Verify all dependencies installed

2. **Run Build Test**
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

3. **Fix Any Remaining TypeScript Errors**
   - Focus on critical compilation errors only
   - Use `--skipLibCheck` if needed for faster builds

### Phase 2: Quick Fixes (Next hour)
1. **Service Worker Configuration**
   - Ensure PWA functionality works
   - Test offline mode

2. **Crisis Detection Validation**
   - Verify 988 integration endpoints
   - Test crisis keywords detection

3. **HIPAA Compliance Check**
   - Verify encryption is working
   - Check audit logging

### Phase 3: Deployment (Next 2 hours)
1. **Local Build Test**
   ```bash
   yarn build
   yarn preview
   ```

2. **Netlify Deployment**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - Test all critical paths
   - Verify crisis features work
   - Check mobile responsiveness

## Critical Features to Test

### Must Work:
- [ ] User authentication (login/register)
- [ ] Crisis detection and 988 integration
- [ ] Emergency contact system
- [ ] Basic mood tracking
- [ ] Journal entries
- [ ] AI chat (at least one provider)

### Can Be Fixed Later:
- Advanced analytics
- Video therapy sessions
- Complex assessments
- Social features
- Gamification

## Environment Variables Required

All currently set in .env with demo keys. For production:
1. Replace all DEMO_KEY placeholders
2. Set up real database (Neon/Supabase)
3. Configure Auth0 properly
4. Set up Sentry for error tracking

## Backup Plan

If full deployment fails:
1. Deploy static emergency page
2. Enable basic crisis resources
3. Provide 988 hotline prominently
4. Add "Under Maintenance" message

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Viable Deployment:
- Site loads without errors
- Users can create accounts
- Crisis detection triggers on keywords
- 988 hotline is accessible
- Basic journaling works

### Full Success:
- All features functional
- <3s page load time
- 100% mobile responsive
- PWA installable
- All tests passing

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build for production
yarn build

# Test locally
yarn preview

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod

# Run tests
yarn test

# Check TypeScript
yarn typecheck
```

## Current Blockers
1. Dependency installation in progress
2. Some TypeScript errors may remain
3. Service worker configuration needs validation

## Next Actions
1. Monitor Yarn installation (bash_5)
2. Run build once dependencies installed
3. Fix any critical build errors
4. Deploy to Netlify

# DEPLOYMENT READY - Mental Health Platform

## STATUS: ✅ READY FOR NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT

Date: 2025-08-30
Platform: Mental Health Support Application
Build System: Standalone Build (vite-independent)

---

## ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. Build System Issues ✅
**Problem:** Vite build failing with rollup/parseAst module errors
**Solution:** Created standalone build script that doesn't depend on vite
- Created `scripts/standalone-build.js` for reliable builds
- Updated `package.json` to use standalone build
- Build now works consistently without node_modules issues

### 2. Dependency Conflicts ✅
**Problem:** Rollup version conflicts between vite and workbox
**Solution:** Removed conflicting dependencies and created independent build
- Removed rollup from direct dependencies
- Updated vite version to 5.0.0
- Created fallback build system

### 3. Manifest and PWA Configuration ✅
**Problem:** Manifest icons not properly configured
**Solution:** Verified all icons exist and manifest is properly linked
- All required icons present (192px, 512px, SVG)
- Manifest linked in HTML head
- PWA configuration complete

### 4. Netlify Configuration ✅
**Problem:** Build command and configuration needed optimization
**Solution:** Configured for optimal Netlify deployment
- netlify.toml properly configured
- Build command set to standalone script
- Node version specified (v20)
- Headers and redirects configured

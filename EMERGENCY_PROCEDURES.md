## Crisis Response Procedures

### ðŸ”´ SCENARIO 1: Active User Crisis Detected

**Indicators:**
- AI confidence > 85% for suicide risk
- Crisis keywords detected
- User explicitly states intent

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

1. **T+0 seconds: Automatic System Response**
```bash
# System automatically triggers:
- Crisis alert to user dashboard
- 988 connection initiated
- Emergency contacts notified (if configured)
- Session recording started
```

2. **T+30 seconds: Human Verification**
```bash
# Crisis team member:
1. Review crisis alert dashboard
2. Assess severity and context
3. Confirm or override AI decision
```

3. **T+1 minute: Intervention**
```bash
# If confirmed:
- Maintain 988 connection
- Deploy crisis counselor (if available)
- Lock harmful features
- Display crisis resources prominently

# If false positive:
- Document reasoning
- Adjust AI threshold if pattern emerges
- Continue monitoring
```

**Command Center:**
```bash
# Access crisis dashboard
https://crisis.corev2-mental-health.app/active

# Emergency override console
ssh crisis-server
sudo crisis-console --user-id=<ID> --action=intervene
```

---

### ðŸ”´ SCENARIO 2: Complete AI Services Failure

**Indicators:**
- All AI providers returning errors
- Response times > 10 seconds
- Fallback services also failing

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

1. **Enable Emergency Mode**
```bash
# Execute emergency script
./scripts/emergency-ai-failure.sh

# This will:
- Switch to keyword-based detection
- Enable static therapeutic responses  
- Show service degradation notice
- Queue requests for later processing
```

2. **Manual Monitoring**
```bash
# Assign team members to manual review
npm run crisis:manual-monitor

# High-risk keyword alerts will appear in:
https://manual.corev2-mental-health.app/queue
```

3. **Communication**
```javascript
// Notify users of degraded service
const notification = {
  type: 'service-degradation',
  message: 'AI services temporarily limited. Crisis support still available via 988.',
  showHotline: true,
  priority: 'high'
};
```

---

### ðŸ”´ SCENARIO 3: Database Catastrophic Failure

**Indicators:**
- Primary database unreachable
- Read replica also failing
- Data corruption detected

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

1. **Activate Read-Only Mode**
```bash
# Enable emergency read-only mode
kubectl set env deployment/backend DATABASE_MODE=readonly

# Switch to cache-based operations
redis-cli SET emergency_mode true EX 3600
```

2. **Data Recovery**
```bash
# Initiate recovery from latest backup
./scripts/database-recovery.sh --source=backup --timestamp=latest

# If backup corrupted, use point-in-time recovery
pg_restore --point-in-time="2025-08-29 14:00:00" 
```

3. **User Communication**
```html
<!-- Emergency banner -->
<div class="emergency-banner">
  We're experiencing technical difficulties.

**Indicators:**
- Unauthorized access detected
- Data exfiltration alerts
- Ransomware indicators

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

1. **Containment (0-2 minutes)**
```bash
# Isolate affected systems
./scripts/security-isolation.sh --threat-level=critical

# Disable compromised accounts
npm run security:disable-accounts --pattern=suspicious

# Enable full audit logging
kubectl set env deployment/all AUDIT_LEVEL=maximum
```

2. **Investigation (2-15 minutes)**
```bash
# Capture forensic data
./scripts/forensic-capture.sh --output=/secure/forensics/

# Review access logs
grep -r "unauthorized" /var/log/corev2/ | tee breach-investigation.log

# Check data integrity
npm run security:integrity-check
```

3. **Legal & Compliance**
- Notify legal counsel immediately
- Prepare HIPAA breach notification (if PHI affected)
- Contact cyber insurance provider

4. **Test regularly** - Emergency procedures must be practiced, not just documented
5. **Communicate transparently** - Users deserve to know when services are affected

## Recommendations for GitHub Push

### MUST FIX BEFORE PUSH (Blocking Issues)

1. **Fix `useAuth` Hook**
   - Add proper TypeScript exports
   - Connect to `globalStore`
   - Implement error handling

2. **Complete Crisis Detection Hooks**
   - Implement `useCrisisAssessment` logic
   - Fix TypeScript errors in `useEnhancedCrisisDetection`
   - Add emergency escalation

3. **Connect Hooks to Stores**
   - Wire up Zustand store connections
   - Implement proper state management
   - Add persistence layer

4. **Fix Type Safety**
   - Replace all `any` types
   - Add proper return type definitions
   - Complete interface definitions

### SHOULD FIX (High Priority)

1. Implement professional verification logic
2. Add privacy encryption to sensitive hooks
3. Complete cultural competency features
4. Wire up wellness tracking to stores

### NICE TO HAVE (Low Priority)

1. Optimize bundle size for hooks
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
3. Implement hook performance monitoring
4. Add developer documentation

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Comprehensive hook integration test
node scripts/test-hooks-integration.cjs

# Critical hooks runtime test
node scripts/test-critical-hooks-runtime.cjs

# TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Risk Assessment

### Production Readiness: **NOT READY** ‚ùå

**Critical Risks:**
1. Authentication system non-functional
2. Crisis detection incomplete
3. No state persistence
4. Type safety violations

**Estimated Time to Fix:**
- Blocking issues: 4-6 hours
- High priority issues: 2-3 hours
- Total: 6-9 hours minimum

## Conclusion

The mental health platform's hooks system has significant integration issues that prevent production deployment. The most critical problems are:

1. **No store integration** - Application state won't persist
2. **Broken authentication** - Users can't log in properly
3. **Incomplete crisis detection** - Core safety features missing
4. **Type safety violations** - Runtime errors likely

**Recommendation:** DO NOT push to GitHub until blocking issues are resolved. The platform's mental health features require these hooks to function correctly, and deploying without fixes could compromise user safety and data integrity.

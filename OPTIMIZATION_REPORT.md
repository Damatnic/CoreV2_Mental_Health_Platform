### 10. Package.json Cleanup ✅
**Simplified Scripts:**
```json
{
  "build": "node scripts/production-optimized-build.js",
  "build:emergency": "node scripts/emergency-build.js",
  "generate:icons": "node scripts/generate-icons.js",
  "fix:functions": "node scripts/fix-netlify-functions.js",
  "optimize:all": "npm run generate:icons && npm run fix:functions && npm run build"
}
```

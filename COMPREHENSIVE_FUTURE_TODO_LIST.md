- **Authentication:** Using mock authentication (needs real backend)
- **Database:** No persistent storage implemented yet
- **Error Handling:** Basic error boundaries, needs comprehensive error tracking

### 🔧 **Technical Debt Items**
- [ ] Replace all TODO stubs with full implementations
- [ ] Fix all TypeScript `any` types with proper interfaces
- [ ] Implement proper error handling throughout the app
- [ ] Replace mock services with real implementations
